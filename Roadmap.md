Currently GGobi is sitting in the 2.1.x series. This is a stable series, but from now on odd minor versions will represent development/testing versions. The even number versions shown below are milestones towards the eventual 3.0, which is probably several years away, if it happens. Incremental releases will adjust the micro version. We are currently approaching a 2.2.0 release (after about one year's work).

  * 2.2.0 main pipeline (before branching for displays)
  * 2.4.0 full pipeline
  * 2.6.0 displays, plots, and renderers
  * 2.8.0 interaction (including "projection") modes
  * 3.0.0 everything else, all cleaned up
