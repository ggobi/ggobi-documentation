# How to report a bug #

If you have done something in GGobi that made it crash, or it did something that is just plain wrong, then you need to file a bug report.  Once you've filed a bug report it is stored in our system and should (eventually) be fixed.

There is one really important things to remember when filing a bug:

'''If we can't reproduce the bug, we can't fix it.'''

This means you need to provide as much information about what GGobi did wrong.

  * Try and provide a step by step guide to reproducing the bug
  * Be as explicit as possible!
  * If the bug only occurs on a particular dataset, please add the dataset as an attachment (you have to do this after the bug has been created)

So now you know what to do, [go file a bug!](http://ggobi.org/ggobi/newticket)
